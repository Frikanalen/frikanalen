Of note is also [our infrastructure Ansible setup and Kubernetes CRDs](infra/).

Some folders have a basic README file of their own.

## Getting in touch / involved

Frikanalen is actively seeking volunteers who want to be part of building our unique service.

If you're curious about the project, please get in touch on our IRC channel #frikanalen on Freenode, or #dev:frikanalen.no on Matrix.

Tech lead for the project is [Tore Sinding Bekkedal](https://github.com/toresbe/) and he can be reached [by mail](mailto:toresbe@gmail.com) as well.

## Current development focus
 
- We are writing a new front-end
    - Migrating functionality from legacy site: Almost completely done!
    - Still needs a user interface for organizations to add their shows to schedules ([#216](https://github.com/Frikanalen/frikanalen/issues/216))
- Filling airtime in a better way
    - New, far more maintainable playout written and deployed
    - Needs to add better instrumentalization, monitoring/alerting (final output is checked for motion, and alerts are sent on pod failure)
    - A better jukebox algorithm to prioritize fresher content and leave bigger gaps for graphics
    - Expand broadcast graphics (in React frontend) to more than just a "next programme" clock (twitter feed?)
- Migrating the remaining bare-metal services to Kubernetes
    - Ceph cluster up and running nicely, need to migrate media from ZFS pool
    - Media asset server serving from Ceph
    - Upload receiver and file mover/processer migrating from systemd/SMB shares to k8s/Ceph
    - Docker container is very much needed for Open Broadcast Encoder (curmudgeonly build process)
    - CasparCG deployed as Docker container - not necessarily in k8s though (stability test running now)
    
## Nice to have in the future:

- It would be useful to have programmatically-generated test data for fkweb (so we can test and develop on realistic but anonymous data)
- It would be very nice to be able to deploy our CRDs directly in the cloud to spin up a full developer instance (using some sort of templating?)
- We should consider migrating to Istio - because it's, like, super neat
