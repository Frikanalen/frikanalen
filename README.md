## Current development focus

- We are migrating to Kubernetes
- We are modernizing our playout code
    - Instrumentalization, monitoring/alerting
    - Intelligently filling idle air time [with graphics](packages/utils/on-air-graphics)
- We are writing a new front-end
    - Migrating functionality from legacy site: Video archive, member sign-up, scheduling, ...
    - The current development is only tested in Chrome and needs cross-browser testing/CSS adjustment
