# On-air graphics

Our video playout system is CasparCG, which means that we have a relatively full-featured
JavaScript renderer that can be used to render - or superimpose - graphics on air.

Currently, all we have is a rather ugly clock that is invoked to fill short gaps between
programmes. Ideally in the longer term we could create some attractive pages that might
be suited to fill longer idle timeslots, with eg. a Twitter feed or a news feed.

Until such time, it is what it is - a clock.
